# Software Tests Summary

We can almost never run a program on _every_ possible input (there are far too many). So testing is really about **choosing a small, smart set of inputs** that still gives us confidence the program is correct. A **coverage criterion** is just a rule that tells you _which_ inputs (or paths, or combinations) you must exercise — e.g. "run every line at least once" or "make every `if` go both true and false". Most of this guide is a tour of different such rules, how to satisfy them, and how they compare in strength. Keep asking two questions while you read: _"What must this criterion make me test?"_ and _"How few tests can I get away with?"_

**How to read this doc.** Each section has: **Key definitions** (the vocabulary), **The recipe** (the mechanical steps to answer an exam question), a **Worked example**, **Exam patterns & gotchas** (traps that lose points), and a **Cheat sheet** (the compressed version to memorize).

## 1. Mutation Testing

> **Plain words:** Mutation testing checks _how good your tests are_ (not the program). The idea: deliberately break the program in tiny ways — each broken copy is a **mutant** — then see whether your test suite notices. A good suite should fail on a broken program. If a mutant slips through with all tests still passing, your tests have a blind spot. Think of it as "planting bugs on purpose to check that your bug-detector actually detects."

**Key definitions:**

- **Mutant** — a copy of program `P` with _one_ small, still-compilable change, written `Pᵢ`. "Syntactically-valid change" just means the edit still compiles/runs (you can't test a program that won't build). Examples: swap an operator (`>` → `>=`, `+` → `-`), or change a boundary. One mutant = one tiny change.
- **Killed (dead) mutant** — at least one test in your suite `T` gives a _different output_ on the mutant `Pᵢ` than on the original `P`. That difference is the test "catching" the planted bug. **Survived** — no test noticed the change (all tests give the same result on `Pᵢ` as on `P`). Surviving mutants point at weak spots in your tests.
- **Equivalent mutant** — the change happens to make _no difference at all_: `Pᵢ` and `P` behave identically on _every possible input_ (e.g. rewriting `a*b` as `b*a`). No test can ever kill it because there is nothing to catch — it's not really a different program. Deciding in general whether two programs always agree is **undecidable** ("undecidable" = no algorithm can answer it correctly for every case; you must argue each one by hand).
- **Mutation score** = `100 × D / (N − E)` — D = killed, N = total mutants, E = equivalent. It's the percentage of _killable_ mutants your suite actually killed. Equivalents are removed from the **denominator** (they were never killable, so counting them would unfairly punish the suite), and never counted as killed. Higher score = stronger test suite.
- **Competent-programmer hypothesis** — the assumption that real programmers write _almost_-correct code, so real bugs are small slips (a wrong operator, an off-by-one), not wild rewrites. **Coupling effect** — the observation that tests catching these small planted bugs also tend to catch bigger, more complex bugs. Together these justify why testing with _single_ tiny changes is worthwhile.
- A mutant survives if **either**: (1) no test even executes the mutated line, **or** (2) a test runs the line but the final _output_ comes out the same anyway (this case includes equivalent mutants). "iff" = "if and only if".

**The recipe (per mutant):**

0. **Precondition:** run the suite `T` against the original `P` first — every test must pass. A failing test means **fix `P` and retest**, not a killed mutant. The whole process iterates: after adding tests, re-run until the score clears the chosen threshold.
1. **Locate** the mutated line and the exact change (e.g. `>` → `>=`).
2. **Find a reaching input** — an input that (a) actually runs the mutated line, AND (b) makes the mutated expression compute a different value there than the original would. Step (b) is called **infection**: the internal state is now "infected" (wrong) at that point. Just running the line isn't enough; the value has to actually diverge.
3. **Propagate:** an infected internal value is useless unless it changes what the program finally _outputs/returns_ — that's **propagation** (the wrong value has to travel out to where a test can see it). Check the return value / output actually differs for that input. If for _every_ input the output stays identical → the change never shows ⇒ **equivalent** (add to E). Otherwise it is **killable**.
4. **Killed?** A mutant is killed iff the _existing_ test suite contains an input from step 2/3 whose asserted value now mismatches. If none → it **survives**.
5. **Count:** N = total mutants, E = equivalents, D = killed.
6. **Score** = `100·D/(N−E)`.
7. **To reach 100%:** for each surviving non-equivalent mutant, add a test whose input flips the mutated expression's outcome AND whose assertion checks the differing result. Boundary-adjacent inputs (the two values straddling a comparison) kill the most mutants per test.

**Worked example:** method `compute(a,b)` with mutants `a*b→a/b`, `a*b→b*a`, `a*b+a→a*b+b`. The `a*b→b*a` mutant is **equivalent** (multiplication is commutative ⇒ no input distinguishes it). Of the 2 non-equivalent mutants, the given suite kills 1 → **score = 1/2 = 50%** (denominator excludes the equivalent one). Adding `assertEquals(3, compute(1,2))` kills the survivor → 100%.

**Exam patterns & gotchas:**

- **Equivalent-mutant arguments that recur:** (a) _commutativity/algebra_ — `a*b`→`b*a` is equivalent. (b) _unreachable difference_ — the mutated value differs only on an input a guard already excludes (e.g. mutating `purchases>=0` when the spec guarantees `purchases≥0`, so the only differing input `0` never changes the output). (c) `>`→`>=` is equivalent only when the boundary value can never occur. Always justify by exhibiting either a _distinguishing input_ (not equivalent) or an _argument that no input distinguishes them_ (equivalent).
- **Score formula:** memorize `100·D/(N−E)`. Equivalents leave the denominator; they are NOT killed. If a question says "considering the equivalent mutants," it means _exclude them from the denominator_.
- **Killing test must assert the differing output**, not just execute the line. Trap: a test can give _full statement/branch coverage yet leave a mutant alive_ because its assertion is too weak. The fix adds the boundary input (e.g. `foo(0)`).
- **Branch coverage ≠ mutants all killed:** 100% branch coverage does NOT guarantee killing all `CONDITIONALS_BOUNDARY` mutants — you cover both branches without testing the _boundary value_ that distinguishes `>` from `>=`. Counterexample: `if(x>0)` tested with x=5 and x=−5 covers both branches, but x=0 (where `>` vs `>=` differ) is never tried → the mutant survives.
- **Writing a surviving mutant on purpose:** pick a comparison, test only inputs _far_ from the boundary so the boundary swap doesn't change any asserted result.

## 2. Control Flow & Coverage Criteria

> **Plain words:** "Control flow" = the order in which statements run and the branch points (`if`, loops) that decide the route. We draw the program as a map — the **Control Flow Graph (CFG)** — and then pick coverage rules that say how thoroughly the map must be walked: every box? every fork-direction? every combination of conditions in a fork? The rules get progressively stronger (and need more tests). The recurring exam skills are: _draw the CFG_, _pick the smallest test set that satisfies a given rule_, and _say how many tests each rule needs_.

**Key definitions:**

- **CFG (Control Flow Graph)** — a diagram of the program's possible routes. Three node shapes: **computation** (rectangle = straight-line code that just runs top to bottom), **decision** (diamond = a condition, with a True edge and a False edge coming out), **merge** (circle = where two branches rejoin). Assume one **entry** and one **exit**; number every node so you can name paths like `1,2,3`.
- **Statement (node) coverage** — every node runs at least once. This is the _weakest_ rule (bare minimum: "no line of code went completely untested").
- **Branch (edge/decision) coverage** — every decision is taken **both** ways: each `if` goes True at least once and False at least once. **Subsumes statement** (see §4 — it forces every node to run too, so it's strictly stronger).
- **Basic-condition coverage** — in a compound condition like `a && b`, each _elementary_ (atomic) part `a` and `b` is individually made both True and False at some point. _Incomparable with branch_ (neither one guarantees the other — see §4 [CE2](#counterexample-library)).
- **Branch-and-condition** — satisfy branch coverage AND basic-condition coverage at the same time.
- **Compound-condition** — test _every combination_ of the atomic conditions in one decision. With N atoms that's up to **2ᴺ** combinations (short-circuit evaluation — where `&&`/`||` stops early once the result is decided — removes some impossible combinations).
- **MC/DC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage)** — for _each_ atomic condition, show it matters _on its own_: find two tests that differ in **only that one condition** and produce **opposite** overall decision results (proving that condition alone can flip the outcome). This needs about **N+1** tests for N conditions — far fewer than the 2ᴺ of compound-condition — because each test is reused across several conditions. Required by aviation-safety standards **DO-178B / ED-12B**.
- **Boundary-interior** — a way to tame loops (which otherwise create infinitely many paths). It splits the loop paths into two classes:
  - **Boundary tests** = paths that _enter the loop but exit after at most one iteration_ (this class also includes the path that skips the loop entirely). **These are exactly what you get by unfolding the CFG into a tree up to the first repeated node** (the loop condition on its 2nd arrival), then stopping and exiting — provide one feasible path for every branch of that tree. In this course, the boundary set is the expected answer.
  - **Interior tests** = the _more general_ case: paths that iterate **2+ times, where the first two iterations differ** from each other. These need you to unfold _further_ (a second iteration), so stopping at the first repeated node does **not** produce them. Mentioned for completeness; usually not required.
  - Quick test (from the course clarification): take a feasible path that starts with the unfolded prefix — _one iteration then exit → boundary; two-or-more differing iterations → interior._ Also aim for full branch coverage on any branches **outside** the loop.
- **Loop-boundary adequacy** — a simpler loop rule: run each loop **0 times, exactly 1 time, and more than 1 time** (the three qualitatively different loop behaviors).

> **⚠️ Loop-boundary vs boundary-interior — don't confuse them** (the word "boundary" means different things):
> | | **Loop-boundary** | **Boundary-interior** |
> |---|---|---|
> | Cares about | iteration **count** | iteration **paths** |
> | Requirement | run loop **0, 1, >1** times | every subpath of the CFG unfolded to the first repeated node (the _boundary_ tests) |
> | Granularity | coarse — ignores which body path runs | fine — distinguishes the body's branches (`if`-T vs `if`-F count separately) |
> | Strength | **base** of the hierarchy; **incomparable** with statement | **near the top**; **subsumes branch** |
>
> Here "boundary" is a false friend: a _loop-boundary_ "boundary" is an **iteration-count edge case** (0/1/many); a _boundary-interior_ "boundary" test is a **path that barely enters the loop**. Example `while(c){ if(d) X else Y }`: loop-boundary just needs it run 0×, 1×, ≥2× (3 tests, indifferent to `d`); boundary-interior forces both the `X` and `Y` body paths.

- **Subsumption:** "A subsumes B" means A is at least as strong — any test set that satisfies A automatically satisfies B, for _every_ program. (Full treatment in §4.)

**The recipe:**

_Drawing the CFG:_ one node per basic block; each `if`/loop condition = a diamond with T/F edges; loop back-edge returns to the condition node; merge after branches. Number nodes; label which source line each represents (line numbers are required).

_Branch coverage + denominator:_ denominator = **number of outgoing edges from decision nodes** = 2 × (number of decisions counted as branches). Example: two `if`s → **4 branches**. Pick a minimal input set hitting each diamond's T and F.

_Boundary-interior (the high-value recipe):_

1. Draw CFG, identify the loop condition node.
2. **Unfold into a tree**, expanding until you reach a node you've _already visited_ (the loop-condition node on its second arrival), then stop and exit the loop.
3. Enumerate every root-to-leaf subpath. **Always include the path that does NOT enter the loop** (condition false on first arrival).
4. For each subpath, find a _feasible_ concrete input. If a prefix is infeasible (e.g. inner index can't exceed outer on iteration 1), state "infeasible" and continue.
5. Each path starts at entry, ends at exit. The set should be **minimal**.

_Compound vs basic condition counting:_

- Compound-condition tests for a single decision with N elementary conditions = up to **2ᴺ**. To "need >100": use **N=7** (`2⁷=128 > 100`) elementary conditions in one decision.
- Basic-condition tests for that same decision = **2** (all-true row + all-false row suffice).

**Worked example:**

```java
void checkNumbers(int[] numbers) {
  2: for (int i=0; i<numbers.length; i++)
  3:   if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0)        // even?
  4:     if (numbers[i] > 10)          // >10?
  5:       System.out.println(...);
  8: (exit)
}
```

Nodes: 2=loop cond, 3=outer if, 4=inner if, 5=print, 8=exit. Unfold to first repeated node → **minimal boundary-interior set:**

```
1,2,3(F),8                          input []   → exit immediately, no print
1,2,3(T),4(T),5(T),6,7,3(F),8       input [12] → prints "12 is even and >10"
1,2,3(T),4(T),5(F),7,3(F),8         input [2]  → even, not >10, nothing printed
1,2,3(T),4(F),7,3(F),8              input [3]  → odd, nothing printed
```

Note the **first path (loop not entered, empty array)** is mandatory and the most-missed.

**Exam patterns & gotchas:**

- **State the boundary-interior definition exactly** ("every subpath until reaching a repeated node").
- **Don't forget the loop-not-entered path** — always part of the boundary set.
- **Nested loops are out of scope** — only single-loop unfolding needed.
- **Infeasible prefixes:** when a tree prefix can't be satisfied (closest-pair: `i<n` true but `j<n` false on first iteration → contradiction), write "infeasible" with the reason; don't invent inputs.
- **Subsumption facts to quote** (all disproofs live in §4's [Counterexample library](#counterexample-library)):
  - boundary-interior **subsumes branch** (covering every subpath including in-loop branches covers every T/F edge).
  - branch **subsumes statement**; statement does NOT subsume branch.
  - branch does **NOT** subsume compound-condition → [CE1](#counterexample-library) (`if(a&&b)`, suite (T,T),(T,F): full branch, never tests (F,T)/(F,F)).
  - **basic-condition and branch are incomparable** → [CE2](#counterexample-library).
  - **loop-boundary and statement have NO subsumption either way** → [CE3](#counterexample-library) (both-directions counterexample).
- **MC/DC test count = N+1**, NOT 2ᴺ.

| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |

**Subsumption ladder (strong → weak):** all-paths ⊃ boundary-interior ⊃ {MC/DC, compound-condition, cyclomatic, LCSAJ} ⊃ branch-and-condition ⊃ branch ⊃ statement; basic-condition and loop-boundary sit at the base, _incomparable_ to branch/statement respectively.

## 3. Data Flow Testing

> **Plain words:** Control-flow testing cared about _which lines run_. Data-flow testing cares about _the life of each variable's value_: where it's **set** (given a value) and where it's later **used**. The worry is a broken link between them — e.g. code sets `x` but a bug means a stale or wrong `x` gets used downstream. So we pair up every "here's where `x` is set" with every "here's where that `x` is read", and require tests that actually travel from the set to the use. Vocabulary below is just names for "set" (**definition**), "read" (**use**), and "a route from set to read that doesn't overwrite `x` on the way" (**def-clear path**).

**Key definitions:**

- **Definition** `d_n(x)` ("def"): `x` is _given a value_ at node n — the left-hand side of `x = …`, a parameter receiving its argument at entry, or reading input into `x`. Parameters count as defined at the entry node.
- **Use** `u_n(x)`: `x`'s value is _read_ (on the right-hand side of an assignment, inside a condition, or as a call argument). Two flavors:
  - **c-use (computation use)** — the value feeds a _computation_ or output (an assignment, a `return`, a `print`); attached to a **NODE**. E.g. `return x+10` is a c-use of `x`.
  - **p-use (predicate use)** — the value is used to _decide a branch_; attached to an **EDGE** — and it counts on **both** the True and False out-edges of that decision. E.g. `if(flag)` is a p-use of `flag`.
- **def-clear path w.r.t. `x`** ("w.r.t." = with respect to): a route where none of the _in-between_ nodes reassign or clear `x`. Meaning: the value set at the start is _still the same value_ when it reaches the end — the link is intact.
- **`d_m(x)` reaches `u_n(x)`**: there exists a def-clear path from the def at m to the use at n — i.e. the value set at m can actually arrive, unchanged, at the use at n.
- **du-path** (definition-use path, n1…nk): a def-clear path from a _definition_ of `x` to a _use_ of `x`. Precisely: n1 has a def of `x`, and **either** nk has a c-use and the path is **simple** (no repeated nodes except possibly the endpoints), **or** the last edge has a p-use and the path up to it is **loop-free**.
- A node like `x = x+1` is _both_ a **use** of `x` (the old value, on the right) **and** a **def** of `x` (the new value, on the left) — order matters: it reads, then overwrites.

**The recipe (mechanical):**

1. **Draw the CFG**, number nodes, force a single entry/single exit (add an exit edge if a `return` dangles).
2. **Annotate each node**: list `d_i(var)` for every assigned variable, and the uses. Predicate node → p-use on **both** out-edges; assignment/return/print node → c-use in the node.
3. **Build the def-use table**: for every (def, use) pair of the same variable, find a def-clear path connecting them. Each such pair is one **obligation** — a thing some test must exercise. The full list of pairs is your obligation set (the checklist to tick off).
4. **Satisfy a criterion:** the criteria below differ only in _how many_ of those def→use pairs you must cover. They range from lazy (`all-defs`: reach _some_ use of each def) to thorough (`all-du-paths`: cover _every_ route to _every_ use). Read the table as "for each definition of `x`, how much must I cover?"

| **all-defs**               | one def-clear path from each def to **some** (any one) use it reaches                     |
| **all-c-uses**             | a def-clear path from each def to **every c-use** it reaches                              |
| **all-p-uses**             | a def-clear path from each def to **every p-use** (both edges) it reaches                 |
| **all-c-uses/some-p-uses** | all c-uses; if a def reaches **no** c-use, then at least one p-use                        |

| **all-uses**               | a def-clear path to **every** use (all c-uses AND all p-uses)                             |
| **all-du-paths**           | **every** def-clear du-path (cycle-free / simple-cycle) to every use — may be exponential |

5. **Feasibility check**: drop infeasible paths; you rarely hit 100%.

**Worked examples — the two dataflow subsumption disproofs** (both live in §4's [Counterexample library](#counterexample-library), so all subsumption counterexamples sit in one place):

- **[CE4](#counterexample-library) — full branch coverage ⊉ all-defs:** a two-`if` program where both tests give 100% branch coverage yet the def of `x` never reaches one of its uses. This is the canonical "all-defs is easy to break" trap (bullet below).
- **[CE5](#counterexample-library) — all-c-uses/some-p-uses ⇎ all-p-uses/some-c-uses:** a nested-`if` program whose one suite satisfies each `/some` criterion while missing the other's obligation, proving the two are **incomparable**.

**Exam patterns & gotchas:**

- p-use lives on the EDGE (count both T and F edges); c-use lives in the NODE. A predicate node has **no defs** by assumption.
- A node like `x = x + 1` is simultaneously a **c-use** and a **def** of x; that def kills earlier defs through it.
- "all-defs" only needs **some** use per def — easy to satisfy, easy to break with branch coverage.
- all-c-uses and all-p-uses are **incomparable**.
- For "/some" criteria: the "some" clause only fires when a def reaches **zero** uses of the other kind.
- all-du-paths can be exponential; when asked to "list all du-paths," include both branches around a diamond.

## 4. Subsumption — Master Cheat Sheet

> **Plain words:** "Subsumption" ranks coverage criteria by strength. Saying **A subsumes B** means: _if you've satisfied A, you've automatically satisfied B_ — A is the tougher bar, so passing it gets B for free. (Example: branch coverage subsumes statement coverage — take every `if` both ways and you can't help but run every line.) The exam skill is almost always the _opposite_ direction: **disprove** a claimed subsumption by inventing one small program + one test suite that satisfies A yet misses B. This section is the toolkit for that.

**Key definitions:**

- **A subsumes B** ("A includes B"): for **every** program P, **every** test suite that satisfies A on P also satisfies B on P. A is then _strictly stronger_. (Note the "for every program" — a single program where A implies B is _not_ enough; it must always hold.)
- **Equivalent**: A subsumes B _and_ B subsumes A (they demand the same coverage). **Incomparable**: neither subsumes the other (each can be satisfied while missing something the other requires).
- Caution: subsumption is a _logical_ relation only — "A is stronger on paper". It does **not** guarantee A finds more real bugs in practice.

**The recipe — to disprove "A subsumes B", find ONE program P + ONE suite T with: T satisfies A on P, but T does NOT satisfy B on P.**

1. Pick the obligation B requires that A does **not**.
2. **Build a tiny program** where that exact obligation can be isolated — a single extra statement, branch, def-use pair, or loop iteration A can skip.
3. **Construct the smallest suite T** meeting all of A's obligations while deliberately avoiding B's distinguishing obligation.
4. **Verify both claims explicitly**: (a) T satisfies A (enumerate A's obligations, show each met); (b) T misses ≥1 of B's obligations (name it).
5. For "no subsumption in BOTH directions" (incomparability), repeat with a **second** program/suite swapping roles.

### Counterexample library

_This is the one place every non-subsumption / incomparability in the doc is proved, each with **one program + one suite**. Other sections point here by ID (**CE1–CE5**). Template for all of them: show T satisfies A (every A-obligation met), then name the single B-obligation T misses._

**CE1 — branch ⊉ compound-condition** (equivalently, branch ⊉ "all 2ᴺ combinations").

```
if (a && b)  X;  else  Y;
```

Suite `{ (a,b)=(T,T), (T,F) }`: the decision is **True** then **False** ⇒ **full branch coverage**. But compound-condition needs all `2²=4` atom-combinations, and `(F,T)`, `(F,F)` are never tried ⇒ **branch ⊉ compound-condition.** _(Referenced from §2.)_

**CE2 — basic-condition ⇎ branch (incomparable, both directions).**

_Direction 1 — branch ⊉ basic-condition._ Program `if (a || b) X; else Y;` with suite `{ (T,F), (F,F) }`: decision **True** then **False** ⇒ full branch, yet atom **`b` is never True** ⇒ basic-condition unmet.
_Direction 2 — basic-condition ⊉ branch._ Program `if (a && b) X; else Y;` with suite `{ (T,F), (F,T) }`: each atom takes **both** T and F ⇒ basic-condition met, yet the decision is **False in both tests** (the true-branch is never taken) ⇒ branch unmet. Neither direction holds ⇒ **incomparable.** _(Referenced from §2.)_

**CE3 — statement ⇎ loop-boundary (incomparable, both directions).**

```
1 int foo(int x, int y) {
2   while (x > 0)
3     x--;
4   if (y == 0)
5     return x;
6   return y; }
```

_Direction 1 (loop-boundary adequate, NOT statement adequate):_ suite `foo(0,0)` (loop 0×), `foo(1,0)` (1×), `foo(2,0)` (>1×). All keep `y==0` ⇒ **statement 6 never executed** ⇒ loop-boundary ⊉ statement.
_Direction 2 (statement adequate, NOT loop-boundary adequate):_ suite `foo(0,0)` (loop 0×, hits line 5) + `foo(1,1)` (loop 1×, hits line 6). **Every statement** executed, but loop **never runs >1** ⇒ statement ⊉ loop-boundary. The two are **incomparable**. _(Referenced from §2.)_

**CE4 — full branch coverage ⊉ all-defs (dataflow).**

```
1 int foo(int w, int y) {
2   int x, z = MAX_INT-1;     // d(x), d(z)
3   if (w < 0) 4: x++;  else 6: z++;     // u+d of x / u+d of z
8   if (y < 0) 9: x++;  else 11: z++;    // u+d of x / u+d of z
13  return 0; }
```

Tests **{w=-1, y=1}** and **{w=1, y=-1}** together take both T and F of each `if` ⇒ **full branch coverage**. But the **def of x at line 2** reaching the use at line 9 needs `w≥0` (skip line 4) AND `y<0` — neither test does this ⇒ **all-defs NOT satisfied** at 100% branch coverage ⇒ branch ⊉ all-defs. _(Referenced from §3.)_

**CE5 — all-c-uses/some-p-uses ⇎ all-p-uses/some-c-uses (incomparable, dataflow).**

```
void foo(int x, int y) {        // node 1: d(x), d(y)
  if (x > 0 && y < 0) {         // node 2: p-use of x,y  (edges 2->3 True, 2->4 False)
    if (x > 10) { return; }     // node 3: p-use of x    (edge 3->5)
  } else {
    print(x, y);                // node 4: c-use of x,y
  }
}                               // 5: return, 6: exit (edge 5->6 added for single exit)
```

- Defs: `d_1(x), d_1(y)`. Uses: nodes 2 & 3 are **p-uses**; node 4 holds the **c-uses**.
- **all-p-uses/some-c-uses** satisfied by **1-2-3-5-6**: def-clear to every p-use; NEVER reaches node 4 → **c-uses at 4 missed**.
- **all-c-uses/some-p-uses** satisfied by **1-2-4-6**: def-clear to every c-use; NEVER takes True branch to node 3 → **p-use at 3 missed**.
- Conclusion: suite {1-2-4-6} satisfies all-c-uses/some-p-uses but fails all-p-uses/some-c-uses, and symmetrically {1-2-3-5-6} the other way ⇒ **incomparable.** _(Referenced from §3.)_

**Exam patterns & gotchas:**

- The counterexample MUST include **both code and the explicit suite**; state for each test which obligation it covers. All the ready-made ones are in the [Counterexample library](#counterexample-library) above (**CE1–CE5**).
- Branch = "all-edges"; statement = "all-nodes"; decision ≡ branch. Branch subsumes statement; **statement does NOT subsume branch** (an `if` with no else).
- **MC/DC subsumes branch.** **Basic-condition vs branch: incomparable** ([CE2](#counterexample-library)). **Branch vs compound-condition: branch ⊉ compound** ([CE1](#counterexample-library)).
- **Boundary-interior subsumes branch.**
- **Loop-boundary (0,1,many) is at the BASE** — incomparable with statement ([CE3](#counterexample-library)); do not confuse with boundary-interior.

Linear reading (⊃ = subsumes): **all-paths ⊃ all-du-paths ⊃ all-uses ⊃ {all-c-uses/some-p-uses, all-p-uses/some-c-uses} ⊃ {all-c-uses, all-defs, all-p-uses} ⊃ all-branches ⊃ all-statements.** Note: **all-c-uses and all-p-uses are incomparable**; **all-c-uses/some-p-uses and all-p-uses/some-c-uses are incomparable**; all-p-uses subsumes all-edges.

**Quick disproof template:** _"To show A does not subsume B: program P = [smallest code isolating B's extra obligation]; suite T = [tests meeting every A-obligation]. T satisfies A because [list A-obligations, each met]. T fails B because it never [the B-obligation A is blind to — an unexecuted statement / untaken edge / unexercised def-use pair / a loop iteration count]. Hence A ⊉ B."_

## 5. Combinatorial / Pairwise Testing (AETG & IPO/IPOG)

> **Plain words:** Suppose a feature has several settings (parameters), each with a few possible values — say Table ∈ {Coffee, Desk, Kitchen}, Color ∈ {Brown, White, Red}, Size ∈ {Small, Medium}. Testing _every_ combination is `3×3×2 = 18` tests here, and explodes fast with more parameters. The insight behind **pairwise (2-way) testing**: most bugs are triggered by _one_ setting or the _interaction of two_ settings, rarely by three-plus at once. So we don't need every full combination — we only need every **pair** of values (from any two parameters) to appear together in _at least one_ test. That collapses the suite dramatically (often to a handful of tests) while still catching the vast majority of interaction bugs. **AETG** and **IPO/IPOG** are two algorithms that build such a small test set.

### What you're GIVEN and what you PRODUCE

- **Given:** a list of **parameters**, and for each one its **set of allowed values** (its "domain"). ⚠️ **Parameters can have any number of values, and different counts each** — e.g. P1 has 3 values, P2 has 3, P3 has 2. This is normal and the exams test it deliberately. There is **no special formula** for the multi-valued case — the mechanics below are identical; the only effect of a bigger domain is _more pairs to cover_ and _uneven pair counts_ when you tally.
- **Produce:** a small set of **tests** (each test = one value chosen for _every_ parameter) such that for **every pair of parameters**, **every** combination of one value from each appears in **at least one** test.

**Key definitions.**

- **t-way / pairwise (t=2):** for every group of `t` parameters, every value-combination of those `t` appears in ≥1 test. Pairwise is the `t=2` case (every _pair_). "At least once" — it does **not** need to be balanced/equal counts.
- **Pair:** a specific (value-of-Pi, value-of-Pj) with i≠j. E.g. `(Table=Coffee, Size=Small)`. Pairs are always across **two different** parameters.
- **π (pi) = the set of pairs still _uncovered_.** This is your running checklist / bookkeeping object. The moment a test covers a pair, cross it off π. **You stop when π is empty** — every pair covered. Keeping π correct is where most exam marks are won or lost.
- **Covering array & orthogonal array — the mental model.** Picture your test set as a **table: one row per test, one column per parameter**, each cell holding a value. Both "arrays" are just names for such a table with a coverage guarantee about its columns:
  - **Covering array `CA(N; t, k, v)`** — a table of `N` rows (tests), `k` columns (parameters), each cell one of `v` values, such that: _pick any `t` columns, and every combination of their values shows up in **at least one** row._ For pairwise (`t=2`): **every pair appears ≥ 1 time** — that's the minimum we actually want. Reading the notation: `N`=#tests, `t`=strength (2 = pairwise), `k`=#parameters, `v`=#values per parameter. Its size grows only **logarithmically in the number of parameters** — why pairwise scales so well. (When parameters have _different_ value counts, people write `CA(N; t, v₁v₂…v_k)` or a "mixed-level" array; the idea is unchanged.)

  - **Orthogonal array `L_Runs(Levels^Factors)`** — the _stronger, balanced_ version: \*pick any two columns, and every combination appears **exactly the same number of times\*** (that fixed count is the array's "index", usually 1). Reading the notation `L4(2³)`: 4 **runs** (rows/tests), 3 **factors** (columns/parameters), each with 2 **levels** (values) — the `³` is the number of columns, the `2` is the values-per-column. So `L8(2⁷)` = 8 tests, 7 binary parameters.

  - **How they relate:** _every orthogonal array is also a covering array, but not vice versa._ "Appears exactly-equally" (orthogonal) is a tighter demand than "appears at least once" (covering). The price of that balance: orthogonal arrays are **rigid** — they exist only for special sizes (e.g. value counts that are prime powers, equal-sized domains) and are often **bigger** than the smallest covering array for the same job. So we usually _build_ covering arrays (via AETG/IPO); an orthogonal array is a nice ready-made table that's sometimes **handed to you as a starting seed** (see "Orthogonal-array seed" below).

  - **Concrete `L4(2³)`** (3 binary parameters, values 1/2):

    ```
    run  P1 P2 P3
     1    1  1  1
     2    1  2  2
     3    2  1  2
     4    2  2  1
    ```

    Check any two columns — e.g. P1 & P3: the pairs (1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2) each appear **exactly once** ⇒ orthogonal (balanced). It's automatically a covering array too (each pair appears ≥ once). A covering array _only_ needs that "≥ once" — so for larger problems it can skip rows an orthogonal array would be forced to keep for balance.

  - **Covering array beats orthogonal — worked contrast (4 binary parameters).** Now take **4** binary parameters (values 0/1). Exhaustive testing = `2⁴ = 16` tests. An **orthogonal** array must have runs divisible by 4 for _every_ column-pair to be balanced, and no orthogonal array exists for 4 binary factors in 4 runs — the smallest is **L8 = 8 runs** (it actually holds up to 7 factors). But a **covering** array (each pair ≥ once, balance not required) does the job in just **5 tests**:

    ```
    run  P1 P2 P3 P4
     1    1  1  1  1
     2    1  0  0  0
     3    0  1  0  0
     4    0  0  1  0
     5    0  0  0  1
    ```

    Verify all `C(4,2)=6` column-pairs — e.g. P1&P4: (1,1) in run 1, (1,0) in run 2, (0,0) in runs 3–4, (0,1) in run 5 ⇒ all four combos present. The same holds for every other pair (each of the 6 pairs gets its 00/01/10/11 exactly as run 1 supplies the `11`, the "one-hot" runs supply the `10`/`01`, and the zero-heavy runs supply `00`). So **5 < 8 < 16**: the covering array is smaller than the orthogonal array precisely because it drops the exactly-equally-often demand and keeps only "appears at least once." (Balance costs the extra 3 rows and buys nothing for pair _coverage_.)

**AETG** (**A**utomatic **E**fficient **T**est **G**enerator) **— the recipe** _(builds one complete test at a time, greedy)_:

1. **Build π** = every pair across every parameter-pair. Count = `Σ_{i<j} |Pi|·|Pj|`. (Optional binary convention: seed with all-0s / all-1s tests first and remove their pairs.)
2. **Repeat until π is empty.** Each pass builds exactly ONE new test:
3. **Pick the first (parameter, value):** the one appearing in the **most remaining pairs of π**. In practice: tally, for each parameter-value, how many uncovered pairs still contain it (an "occurrence count" table), and take the max. Ties → first in listed order.
4. **Generate `m` candidate tests.** Each candidate fills the _remaining_ parameters in some **order** (given by the question, or random). `m` is a setting you choose (e.g. m=1 or m=3).
5. **Greedy per-parameter fill:** going through that candidate's order, for each next parameter choose the **value that forms the most pairs still in π with the values already fixed so far.** ⚠️ Only look **back** at already-assigned parameters, never ahead. Ties → first value. _(Multi-valued changes nothing here — you simply have more values to try; count each and take the max.)_
6. **Score each finished candidate** = total pairs in π it covers (re-count over the _whole_ test).
7. **Keep the max-score candidate** (ties → first); add it as a test, remove all its pairs from π. Back to step 2.

**Sub-skill: "list all pairs to add when extending to a new parameter"** (a very common AETG/IPO sub-question). "You already have a pairwise set covering P1, P2; now add a new parameter P3 — list all pairs that must be covered." **Answer = only the pairs that involve the new parameter** (the P1–P2 pairs are already done, don't re-list them). That is: every value of P3 × every value of each existing parameter.

> **Formula:** pairs to add = `Σ over each existing Pj of ( |Pj| × |P3| )`.
> **Example (multi-valued):** P1={Coffee,Desk} (2), P2={Brown,White,Red} (3), new P3={S,M,L} (3) → P1×P3 = `2×3 = 6` pairs + P2×P3 = `3×3 = 9` pairs = **15 pairs** to add.
>
> ⚠️ **This counts _pairs_, not _tests_.** All 15 are distinct (P1×P3 pairs use P1's values, P2×P3 pairs use P2's values — nothing overlaps), so you can't lower the 15. But the number of _tests_ needed is far smaller, because **one test covers several pairs at once**: a row `(Coffee, Brown, S)` knocks out `(Coffee,S)` _and_ `(Brown,S)` together. That reuse is exactly what IPO horizontal growth does — append a P3 value to an existing row and it covers one P1×P3 pair and one P2×P3 pair simultaneously.

**IPO** (**I**n-**P**arameter-**O**rder; the _t_-way generalization is **IPOG**, IPO-**G**eneral) **— the recipe** _(adds one parameter at a time; deterministic)_:

The core idea: start with a table that's already pairwise-correct for the **first two** parameters, then bring in each new parameter one at a time. Adding a parameter is done in two moves — **grow the table sideways** (widen the rows you already have) first, and only if that leaves pairs uncovered, **grow it downward** (add new rows). Sideways is free coverage (no new tests); downward is the last resort.

1. **Initialization:** write out the **full** cross-product of the first two parameters — every `(P1-value, P2-value)` combination, one per row. (With only two parameters each row _is_ a pair, so there's no way to do fewer; this is `|P1|×|P2|` rows.)
2. **For each next parameter Pᵢ (P3, then P4, …):**
   - **a. Build π** = all the new pairs this parameter introduces = every `(value of an earlier parameter Pj, value of Pᵢ)` — exactly the "pairs involving the new parameter" from the sub-skill above. (Earlier parameters are already mutually covered; only pairs _touching Pᵢ_ are new.)
   - **b. Horizontal (sideways) growth — widen existing rows, add NO new rows.** Go down the existing rows top to bottom and **append one Pᵢ-value to each**. For a given row, appending value `b` covers, in one shot, the pair of `b` with _every_ earlier parameter's value already in that row — so pick the `b` that covers the **most pairs still in π** (ties → first listed value). Cross those pairs off π before moving to the next row. You have exactly as many rows as before, so at most `#rows` distinct Pᵢ-values get placed here; if Pᵢ has more values (or more pairs than rows can absorb), some pairs are left for step c.
   - **c. Vertical (downward) growth — add new rows for the leftovers.** Any pair still in π after horizontal growth needs a fresh row. For each leftover pair `(Pj=a, Pᵢ=b)`: **first try to reuse** an existing vertical-growth row — one whose Pj slot is already `a` **or** blank _and_ whose Pᵢ slot is already `b` **or** blank — and fill in its blanks. **Only if none fits, add a brand-new row** with `Pj=a`, `Pᵢ=b`, and **`*` (don't-care = "any value")** in every other column. Reusing rows before adding new ones is what keeps the suite small.
   - **d.** Replace any leftover `*` with any valid value, then move on to the next parameter Pᵢ₊₁ (its horizontal growth now runs over _all_ rows, including the ones vertical growth just added).

**Worked example A — AETG from scratch (3 binary parameters, full run).** P1,P2,P3 ∈ {0,1}. Conventions (state them in your answer): one candidate per test (**m=1**); within a candidate, fill the still-unassigned parameters in **index order** P1→P2→P3; all ties (seed and value) break to the **first-listed** value/parameter. Show every step.

**Build π** — `Σ_{i<j}|Pi|·|Pj| = 4+4+4 = 12` pairs (subscript = which parameter-pair):

```
P1P2: (0,0)(0,1)(1,0)(1,1)   P1P3: (0,0)(0,1)(1,0)(1,1)   P2P3: (0,0)(0,1)(1,0)(1,1)
```

_Test 1._ **Seed tally** — every value sits in 2 pairs of each of its 2 parameter-pairs ⇒ all six values score **4**, all tied ⇒ seed = **P1=0**. **Greedy fill:** P2 — with P1=0, P2=0 makes (0,0)ₚ₁₂=1, P2=1 makes (0,1)ₚ₁₂=1 → tie → **P2=0**; P3 — with (P1,P2)=(0,0), P3=0 makes (0,0)ₚ₁₃+(0,0)ₚ₂₃=2, P3=1 makes 2 → tie → **P3=0**. ⇒ **Test 1 = (0,0,0)**, score 3, remove (0,0)ₚ₁₂,(0,0)ₚ₁₃,(0,0)ₚ₂₃ → **9 pairs left**.

_Test 2._ **Seed tally** on the 9 remaining: P1=1→4 (its 2 P1P2 + 2 P1P3 pairs all alive), P2=1→4, P3=1→4, while P1=0/P2=0/P3=0 →2 each. Tie at 4 → first parameter → seed = **P1=1**. **Fill:** P2 — P2=0 makes (1,0)ₚ₁₂=1, P2=1 makes (1,1)ₚ₁₂=1 → tie → **P2=0**; P3 — with (1,0): P3=0 makes (1,0)ₚ₁₃=1 [(0,0)ₚ₂₃ already gone], P3=1 makes (1,1)ₚ₁₃+(0,1)ₚ₂₃=2 → **P3=1**. ⇒ **Test 2 = (1,0,1)**, score 3, remove (1,0)ₚ₁₂,(1,1)ₚ₁₃,(0,1)ₚ₂₃ → **6 left**: P1P2:(0,1)(1,1) · P1P3:(0,1)(1,0) · P2P3:(1,0)(1,1).

_Test 3._ **Seed tally:** P2=1 → (0,1)ₚ₁₂+(1,1)ₚ₁₂ + (1,0)ₚ₂₃+(1,1)ₚ₂₃ = **4** (the max) → seed = **P2=1**. **Fill** (remaining P1,P3 in index order): P1 — with P2=1: P1=0 makes (0,1)ₚ₁₂=1, P1=1 makes (1,1)ₚ₁₂=1 → tie → **P1=0**; P3 — with (P1,P2)=(0,1): P3=0 makes 0 [(0,0)ₚ₁₃ gone, (1,0)ₚ₂₃ alive→ wait uses P2=1 ⇒ (1,0)ₚ₂₃=1]; recount → P3=0: (0,0)ₚ₁₃ gone + (1,0)ₚ₂₃=1 → 1; P3=1: (0,1)ₚ₁₃=1 + (1,1)ₚ₂₃=1 → 2 → **P3=1**. ⇒ **Test 3 = (0,1,1)**, score 3, remove (0,1)ₚ₁₂,(0,1)ₚ₁₃,(1,1)ₚ₂₃ → **3 left**: P1P2:(1,1) · P1P3:(1,0) · P2P3:(1,0).

_Test 4._ **Seed tally:** P1=1→2, P2=1→2, P3=0→2 (all others 0); tie → first → seed = **P1=1**. **Fill:** P2 — P2=1 makes (1,1)ₚ₁₂=1 → **P2=1**; P3 — with (1,1): P3=0 makes (1,0)ₚ₁₃+(1,0)ₚ₂₃=2 → **P3=0**. ⇒ **Test 4 = (1,1,0)**, score 3, π **empty**.

**Answer — 4 tests:** `(0,0,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,0)`. Verify (write this too): every one of the 12 pairs appears — e.g. P2P3 gets (0,0)t1,(0,1)t2,(1,1)t3,(1,0)t4. ✓

> **When m>1** the only change is step "generate candidates": at each test you build `m` candidates (each with its own fill order), **score every candidate over its whole finished test**, and keep the highest (ties → first). E.g. at Test 2 above, a second candidate with fill order P3→P2 yields `(1,1,0)` also scoring 3 — a genuine tie, so m=1 vs m=2 give the same test here; on larger problems a second order often scores higher and is kept, shrinking the final suite.

**Worked example B — multi-valued AETG (uneven domains), full run.** P1={C,D} (2), P2={B,W,R} (3), P3={S,M} (2). Same conventions (m=1, index fill order, ties→first).

**Build π** — `|P1||P2| + |P1||P3| + |P2||P3| = 6+4+6 = 16` pairs:

```
P1P2: (C,B)(C,W)(C,R)(D,B)(D,W)(D,R)   P1P3: (C,S)(C,M)(D,S)(D,M)   P2P3: (B,S)(B,M)(W,S)(W,M)(R,S)(R,M)
```

_Test 1._ **Seed tally:** C→5 (3 in P1P2 + 2 in P1P3), D→5, S→5 (2 in P1P3 + 3 in P2P3), M→5, each of B/W/R→4. Tie at 5 → first → seed = **P1=C**. **Fill:** P2 — (C,B)(C,W)(C,R) all =1 → tie → **B**; P3 — with (C,B): S makes (C,S)ₚ₁₃+(B,S)ₚ₂₃=2, M makes 2 → tie → **S**. ⇒ **Test 1 = (C,B,S)**, score 3, remove (C,B),(C,S),(B,S) → **13 left**.

_Test 2._ **Seed tally** (13 left): D→5 [(D,B)(D,W)(D,R)+(D,S)(D,M)], M→5 [(C,M)(D,M)+(B,M)(W,M)(R,M)], C→3, W→4, R→4, S→3, B→2. Tie D vs M at 5 → first parameter → seed = **P1=D**. **Fill:** P2 — (D,B)(D,W)(D,R) all=1 → **B**; P3 — with (D,B): S makes (D,S)ₚ₁₃=1 [(B,S) gone], M makes (D,M)ₚ₁₃+(B,M)ₚ₂₃=2 → **M**. ⇒ **Test 2 = (D,B,M)**, score 3, remove (D,B),(D,M),(B,M) → **10 left**.

_Test 3._ **Seed tally:** W→4 [(C,W)(D,W)+(W,S)(W,M)], R→4, else ≤3. Tie W vs R → **P2=W**. **Fill** (remaining P1,P3): P1 — with P2=W: (C,W)=1,(D,W)=1 → tie → **C**; P3 — with (C,W): S makes 0+(W,S)=1 [(C,S) gone], M makes (C,M)ₚ₁₃+(W,M)ₚ₂₃=2 → **M**. ⇒ **Test 3 = (C,W,M)**, score 3, remove (C,W),(C,M),(W,M) → **7 left**: P1P2:(C,R)(D,W)(D,R) · P1P3:(D,S) · P2P3:(W,S)(R,S)(R,M).

_Test 4._ **Seed tally:** R→4 [(C,R)(D,R)+(R,S)(R,M)] is the max → seed = **P2=R**. **Fill:** P1 — (C,R)=1,(D,R)=1 → tie → **C**; P3 — with (C,R): S makes (R,S)ₚ₂₃=1 [(C,S) gone], M makes (R,M)ₚ₂₃=1 → tie → **S**. ⇒ **Test 4 = (C,R,S)**, score **2** (only (C,R),(R,S); (C,S) already covered) → **5 left**: P1P2:(D,W)(D,R) · P1P3:(D,S) · P2P3:(W,S)(R,M).

_Test 5._ **Seed tally:** D→3 [(D,W)(D,R)+(D,S)] → seed = **P1=D**. **Fill:** P2 — (D,W)=1,(D,R)=1 → tie → **W**; P3 — with (D,W): S makes (D,S)ₚ₁₃+(W,S)ₚ₂₃=2, M makes 0 → **S**. ⇒ **Test 5 = (D,W,S)**, score 3, remove (D,W),(D,S),(W,S) → **2 left**: P1P2:(D,R) · P2P3:(R,M).

_Test 6._ **Seed tally:** R→2 [(D,R)+(R,M)] → seed = **P2=R**. **Fill:** P1 — (D,R)=1 → **D**; P3 — with (D,R): M makes (R,M)ₚ₂₃=1 → **M**. ⇒ **Test 6 = (D,R,M)**, score 2, π **empty**.

**Answer — 6 tests** (vs `2×3×2 = 12` exhaustive): `(C,B,S), (D,B,M), (C,W,M), (C,R,S), (D,W,S), (D,R,M)`. Verify: P1P2 gets all 6, P1P3 all 4 [(C,S)t1,(C,M)t3,(D,S)t5,(D,M)t2], P2P3 all 6. ✓ Takeaway: multi-valued is purely mechanical — bigger domains just mean more values to tally and more pairs to clear; the not-every-test-scores-3 rows (t4, t6) are normal near the end.

**Worked example C — IPOG (full trace: init → horizontal → vertical).** Three parameters: P1={1,2}, P2={1,2}, P3={1,2,3}. (P3 has 3 values, so horizontal growth _can't_ place them all in the 4 existing rows — that's what forces vertical growth, the part exams love to test.)

**Step 1 — Initialize** with the P1×P2 cross-product (4 rows):

```
row  P1 P2
 1    1  1
 2    1  2
 3    2  1
 4    2  2
```

**Step 2 — Add P3.** π = the 12 pairs touching P3: P1×P3 = (1,1)(1,2)(1,3)(2,1)(2,2)(2,3) and P2×P3 = (1,1)(1,2)(1,3)(2,1)(2,2)(2,3) _(read each as (Pj-value, P3-value))_.

**2b — Horizontal growth** (append a P3 value to each existing row; pick the value covering the most still-uncovered pairs, counting against **both** P1 and P2 in that row):

| row | P1 P2 | try P3=1                      | P3=2                  | P3=3 | pick              | pairs removed from π |
| --- | ----- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- | ---- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| 1   | 1 1   | (P1:1,P3:1)+(P2:1,P3:1)=**2** | 2                     | 2    | **1** (tie→first) | (1,1)ₚ₁, (1,1)ₚ₂     |
| 2   | 1 2   | 1                             | (1,2)ₚ₁+(2,2)ₚ₂=**2** | 2    | **2**             | (1,2)ₚ₁, (2,2)ₚ₂     |
| 3   | 2 1   | 1                             | (2,2)ₚ₁+(1,2)ₚ₂=**2** | 2    | **2**             | (2,2)ₚ₁, (1,2)ₚ₂     |
| 4   | 2 2   | (2,1)ₚ₁+(2,1)ₚ₂=**2**         | 0                     | 2    | **1** (tie→first) | (2,1)ₚ₁, (2,1)ₚ₂     |

Rows after horizontal growth, and what's **left in π** (4 pairs — all the P3=3 pairs, since value 3 never got placed):

```
1  1  1        π left = { (P1:1,P3:3), (P1:2,P3:3),
1  2  2                   (P2:1,P3:3), (P2:2,P3:3) }
2  1  2
2  2  1
```

**2c — Vertical growth** (each leftover pair needs a row; reuse a `*` row before adding a new one):

- `(P1=1,P3=3)` → no rows yet, add **row 5 = (1, \*, 3)**.
- `(P2=1,P3=3)` → row 5 has P2=`*` and P3=3 already ⇒ **fill the blank**: row 5 = (1, **1**, 3).
- `(P1=2,P3=3)` → row 5 has P1=1 (fixed, ≠2), can't reuse ⇒ add **row 6 = (2, \*, 3)**.
- `(P2=2,P3=3)` → row 6 has P2=`*` and P3=3 ⇒ fill: row 6 = (2, **2**, 3).

π is now empty. **Final suite — 6 tests** (vs `2×2×3 = 12` exhaustive):

```
row  P1 P2 P3
 1    1  1  1
 2    1  2  2
 3    2  1  2
 4    2  2  1
 5    1  1  3
 6    2  2  3
```

Sanity-check one pair-type: P2×P3 → (1,1) r1, (2,2) r2, (1,2) r3, (2,1) r4, (1,3) r5, (2,3) r6 ⇒ all six present. ✓ The two takeaways: horizontal growth did the bulk of the work "for free" (no new rows for values 1 & 2), and vertical growth added the minimum rows for value 3, **reusing row 5 before opening row 6**.

**Special-parameter twists** (recurring "adapt the algorithm" sub-questions):

- **Fault-prone parameter — "each value of P3 must appear ≥ twice with every other value":** change π construction — **put every pair that involves P3 into π twice**; leave the other pairs at multiplicity one. Run growth/greedy normally, but **remove only ONE copy** of a doubled pair each time a test covers it — so the pair must be covered twice before it leaves π. (Works for both IPO and AETG. Do **not** try to reason about final test counts; manipulating π is the clean way.)
- **Critical parameter — "(P2,1) must appear in ≥ 75% of tests":** this is a _frequency_ constraint, not a pair constraint, so **don't fiddle with π counts** (you don't know the final test count in advance). Instead, in AETG: when choosing the first (param,value) of each new test, if (P2,1) is currently in < 75% of tests so far, **force-select it**; and after all pairs are covered, keep **adding redundant tests containing (P2,1)** until the 75% threshold is met.
- **Orthogonal-array seed:** if you're handed an orthogonal array (or any set of prebuilt tests), use it as the **starting tests**: build the full pair list, **strike out every pair those seed tests already cover**, then run AETG/IPO only on what's left → far fewer iterations.

  > ⚠️ **Why you can't just _duplicate_ an OA's columns to fake more parameters** (a classic "why doesn't this work?"). Tempting shortcut: you have `L4(2³)` covering 3 parameters and you want 6, so you copy the 3 columns to the right (P4:=P1, P5:=P2, P6:=P3):
  >
  > ```
  > run  P1 P2 P3 | P4 P5 P6      (P4=P1, P5=P2, P6=P3)
  >  1    1  1  1 |  1  1  1
  >  2    1  2  2 |  1  2  2
  >  3    2  1  2 |  2  1  2
  >  4    2  2  1 |  2  2  1
  > ```
  >
  > The trap is the pair **between a column and its own clone** — e.g. P1 & P4. Because P4 is _identical_ to P1 in every row, that column-pair only ever shows the **matching** values `(1,1)` and `(2,2)`; the **mismatched** pairs `(1,2)` and `(2,1)` can **never** appear. So pairwise coverage is broken for P1–P4, P2–P5, and P3–P6. (Cross pairs like P1–P5 are fine — they're just the original P1–P2 pairs again.) Duplication buys columns but not coverage; you must genuinely extend the array (add the missing pairs via AETG/IPO), not clone it.

**Exam patterns & gotchas.**

- **m=1 vs m=3:** larger `m` → more candidates per step → **fewer total tests** but **more computation**. m=1 is fast but yields a bigger suite. AETG is **non-deterministic** (random orders); IPOG is **deterministic**.
- **Multi-valued parameters are not special** — no formula changes. The only visible effect: uneven pair counts (a 3-value parameter shows up in more pairs than a 2-value one), so occurrence tallies come out uneven. Just count carefully.
- **Counting traps (#1 point-loser):** (a) when picking a value, count pairs only against **already-assigned** parameters; (b) a pair scores only if it's **still in π**; (c) re-count the candidate's score over the **whole** finished test; (d) in IPO, try to **reuse a `*`/blank row before adding a new one**; (e) **remove covered pairs from π after every assignment** — forgetting this double-counts.
- **"List all pairs for a new parameter" = only pairs involving that parameter** (see the formula above). Don't re-list already-covered pairs.

## 6. Symbolic Execution

> **Plain words:** Instead of running the program on _actual numbers_, run it on _symbols_ that stand for "any input". As you walk one path through the code, you track two things: **PV** = what each variable now equals _in terms of those symbols_ (e.g. `c1 = X*X`), and **PC** = the list of conditions the inputs must satisfy to have taken this exact path (e.g. `X > Y`). At the end, the PC is a set of equations; if a solver can find numbers satisfying it, those numbers are a real test input that drives this path — and if the PC is contradictory (unsatisfiable), the path is **impossible** and needs no test. This is how you prove things like "this ERROR line can never be reached".

**Key definitions.**

- **Symbolic value** — instead of a concrete number, each input is given an uppercase symbol standing for "whatever the caller passes" (`x→X`, `arr→A`, its length → `SIZE_OF_A`). Literal constants (like `1`, `0`) stay as themselves.
- **Symbolic state / PV (Program Variables)** — the current value of every variable written as a formula in those symbols. An **assignment** updates PV (e.g. after `c1 = x*x`, PV has `c1 = X*X`); it never touches the PC.
- **Path condition (PC)** — the running list of branch conditions joined by AND (`/\`), recording what must be true to follow this path. Taking a branch's **True** side appends the condition; taking the **False** side appends its **negation** (`!condition`).
- **Feasibility / SAT** — a path is _feasible_ (a real input can follow it) exactly when its PC is **satisfiable**. You hand the PC to a constraint solver, which answers **SAT** (+ a concrete example — "here are numbers that work"), **UNSAT** (no numbers can satisfy it), **UNKNOWN**, or **TIMEOUT**. UNSAT ⇒ path infeasible ⇒ that code is unreachable via this path.
- **Reaching ERROR** — to check whether a specific `ERROR` line can run, AND together the conditions of exactly the branches on the route to it, and test that PC for satisfiability.

**The recipe — columns `line | PV | PC`:**

1. **Entry:** bind every parameter to its symbol in PV. PC empty.
2. **Assignment:** update only PV (substitute current symbols), e.g. `c1 = X*X`.
3. **Branch:** nothing in PV; append constraint to PC with `/\`. **Convention: take the FALSE branch first**, then negate that last constraint to flip to True on the next run. Simplify and say so (`X != X+1 ≡ TRUE`, `X == X+1 ≡ FALSE`).
4. **Return/ERROR:** write symbolic return value in PV, or mark `ERROR`.
5. After each run: state the **symbolic return value** and the **full PC**; then negate the last branch and re-run.

**Worked example — unreachable ERROR:**

```
void foo(double x){ c1 = x*x; if (c1+1==0){ if (c1-1==0){ ERROR; }}}
```

| line  | PV        | PC                           |
| ----- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| entry | x = X     |                              |
| c1    | c1 = X\*X |                              |
| if1   |           | X\*X + 1 == 0                |
| if2   |           | X*X + 1 == 0 /\ X*X - 1 == 0 |

- **Full PC to ERROR:** `X*X + 1 == 0 /\ X*X - 1 == 0`.
- **Reachable? NO.** `X*X + 1 == 0` forces `X*X = -1`, impossible for real X (would need imaginary `i`); also both `v+1==0` and `v-1==0` can't hold at once. Canonical **unreachable-error** pattern.
- **Branch-coverage denominator:** two `if`s ⇒ `2 × 2 = 4`.

**Worked example — false-branch-first:**

```
runSymbolic(int x,int y){ if(x>y) x=y+1; else y=x+1; if(x==y) ERROR; return x+y; }
```

Run 1 (false branch first ⇒ `X<=Y`, line `y=x+1` runs):
| line | PV | PC |
|---|---|---|
| entry | x=X, y=Y | |
| if1(F) | | X <= Y |
| y=x+1 | y = X+1 | |
| if2(F) | | X <= Y /\ X != X+1 ≡ X <= Y |
| return | 2\*X + 1 | |

Symbolic return `2*X+1`, PC `X <= Y`. Negate last → aim at ERROR: PC becomes `X <= Y /\ X == X+1 ≡ FALSE` ⇒ **infeasible**, ERROR unreachable on this branch.

**Exam patterns & gotchas.**

- **Branch denominator** = `2 × #decisions` (loop conditions count).
- **Unreachable errors:** spot UNSAT PCs — `x*x+1==0`, `v+1==0 /\ v-1==0`, `x>0 /\ y>0 /\ x+y<0`. Answer "not reachable" + algebraic reason; never invent an input.
- **Satisfying input:** if the PC is SAT, give one concrete tuple that satisfies it (for PC `X<=Y`, answer `x=0, y=0`). **Finding an array out-of-bounds bug is the same skill:** an access `arr[b+1]` is only safe while `0 ≤ b+1 ≤ SIZE_OF_A − 1`, so to _hit_ the bug you add the violating constraint `b+1 > SIZE_OF_A − 1` to the PC and solve. E.g. `arr` has 4 slots (indices 0–3, `SIZE_OF_A = 4`) and the code reads `arr[b+1]`: solving `b+1 > 3` gives `b = 3`, which reads index 4 — one past the end ⇒ out-of-bounds.
- **MC/DC variant:** build MC/DC cases first, then one symbolic run per case, adding each basic condition's required truth value to the PC. For `a /\ b /\ c`: runs `a/\b/\c`, `!a/\b/\c`, `a/\!b/\c`, `a/\b/\!c`. If MC/DC impossible for a condition, fall back to ordinary symbolic execution.
- Assignments update PV only; branches update PC only — never both on one row.

**Cheat sheet.**

- Columns `line | PV | PC`. Conjunction `/\`, negation `!`/`¬`. Inputs UPPERCASE; array length `SIZE_OF_A`.
- **False branch first**; negate-last-constraint to explore sibling; simplify & state equivalences; always write explicit symbolic return + full PC; give satisfying input only when SAT.
- Branch denominator = `2 × #decisions`.

## 7. Concolic Testing (DART & CUTE)

> **Plain words:** Pure symbolic execution (§6) breaks down when the maths gets too hard for the solver — a non-linear formula, a function whose source you don't have, a messy pointer. Concolic testing fixes this by running the program on **real inputs and symbols at the same time** ("**conc**rete + symb**olic**" = concolic). It keeps the symbolic PC to reason about paths, but whenever the solver gets stuck it just plugs in the _actual concrete value_ from the real run and moves on. To reach a new path it takes the last branch condition and flips it, then asks the solver for an input satisfying the flipped condition — repeat until you hit the target (e.g. ERROR).

**Key definitions.**

- **Concolic = concrete + symbolic, side by side.** The real (concrete) values keep the program running; the symbolic side reasons about paths. When the solver can't cope (an opaque/non-linear function, a pointer), you **fall back to the concrete value** instead of getting stuck.
- **DART (Directed Automated Random Testing)** — start from random inputs, record the branch conditions hit, then negate them one at a time to steer execution down not-yet-taken paths. For a black-box function it just substitutes the concrete number the function actually returned.
- **CUTE (Concolic Unit Testing Engine)** — extends this to pointers and dynamic data structures (linked lists, trees) using **logical addresses**: rather than reasoning about raw memory addresses (which change run to run), it treats "same value ⇒ same logical location". NULL tests become symbolic constraints like `P==NULL`, `PN==NULL`.
- **Pointer symbol notation** (how a pointer chain maps to symbols): `p→P`, `p->v→PV` (the value field), `p->next→PN` (the next pointer), `p->next->v→PNV`, `p->next->next→PNN`, … — i.e. append a letter per field you follow.

**The recipe — columns `line | concrete state | PV (symbolic) | PC`:**

1. **Pick initial input** —
   - **Linked-list / int-from-zero:** first random int starts at **0**, increment by 1 until the PC holds; pointers start `NULL`.
   - **Black-box arithmetic:** initial `x,y = 1`.
2. **Run the table:** concrete column = real values / data-structure graph; PV = symbols; PC appends each branch constraint with `/\`, mark `(True)/(False)`. Black-box `result = f(x)`: PV gets token `THIRD_PARTY_FUNCTION`; concrete column gets the _actual computed number_.
3. **Report:** concrete input, concrete output, symbolic PC.
4. **Negate the last branch constraint**, solve for next input (increment int from 0 until PC holds; grow list by one cell when `->next != NULL` needed).
5. **Repeat until ERROR.** Linked-list NULL-check ⇒ **4 iterations**; black-box equality ⇒ **2 tables**.

**Worked example — CUTE, logical addresses, start ints at 0, 4 iterations:**

```
void bar(cell* p){ if (p==NULL || p->next==NULL) return; if (p->v > p->next->v) ERROR; }
```

| iter | concrete                   | PC                                                           |
| ---- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | `p=NULL`                   | `P == NULL` (True) → return                                  |
| 2    | 1-cell list (`next=NULL`)  | `P==NULL \|\| PN==NULL` (True) → return                      |
| 3    | 2-cell list, both non-null | `P==NULL \|\| PN==NULL` (False); `PV > PNV` (False) → return |
| 4    | 2-cell, `PV=1, PNV=0`      | `...` (False); `PV > PNV` (True) → **ERROR**                 |

Final PC to ERROR: `P != NULL /\ PN != NULL /\ PV > PNV`. (A variant has the same shape with inner `(PV-PNV)²>4`; the non-linear term is exactly where the **concrete** value is needed — pick `PV=3, PNV=0` so `9>4` ⇒ ERROR.)

**Worked example — black-box `thirdPartyFunction` (start x,y=1, 2 tables):**

```
computeResult(x,y){ result = thirdPartyFunction(x); if (result==y) ERROR; return result; }
// hidden: 100x³+200x²+300x+20346
```

- **Table 1** `x=1, y=1`: engine runs f for real → concrete `result = 20346`; PV token `THIRD_PARTY_FUNCTION`; PC `THIRD_PARTY_FUNCTION != Y`; returns 20346.
- Negate ⇒ need `THIRD_PARTY_FUNCTION == Y`; solver can't invert the opaque function, so **reuse the concrete output**: set `y = 20346, x = 1`.
- **Table 2** `x=1, y=20346`: `result=20346`, PC `THIRD_PARTY_FUNCTION == Y` → **ERROR**. Input `(1, 20346)`.

**Exam patterns & gotchas.**

- **Basic-condition denominator** = `2 × #atomic conditions`. `bar` has 3 atoms ⇒ **6**.
- **"Can you get full branch coverage _without_ full basic-condition coverage?"** (a common yes/no sub-question) — **yes**, because of short-circuiting. In `if (p==NULL || p->next==NULL)`: a test with `p==NULL` takes the true branch (and `p->next==NULL` is never even evaluated, thanks to `||` stopping early); a test with a full 2-cell list takes the false branch. Both branches are now covered, yet the atom `p->next==NULL` was never made true on its own ⇒ basic-condition coverage is still incomplete.
- **Iterations:** NULL-check list ⇒ 4; black-box equality ⇒ 2 tables. (4 is the suggested count; other counts can be acceptable.)
- **Black-box/non-linear:** keep a symbolic token, fill concrete column with the real value, and reuse that concrete value as the next input when inverting. Never algebraically solve the opaque function.
- **Choose the initial input by convention:** 0-and-increment for lists, 1 for black-box; pointers start NULL.
- Always **negate the last constraint** (not an earlier one); grow the structure by one node when the negated constraint needs a non-null `next`.

**Cheat sheet.**

- Columns `line | concrete | PV | PC`. `/\` conj, `||` disj, mark `(True)/(False)`.
- Pointer symbols `P, PV, PN, PNV, PNN, …`; black-box token `THIRD_PARTY_FUNCTION`.
- Per iteration write: concrete input, concrete output, symbolic PC, how next input is chosen.
- Random ints start **0** (lists) or **1** (black-box); pointers NULL; iterate negate→resolve until ERROR.
- Basic-condition denominator = `2 × #atomic conditions`.

## 8. FSM-based Testing (UIO, DS, W-set)

> **Plain words:** Some systems have _memory_ — the same input does different things depending on what happened before (a vending machine, a login flow). We model these as a **Finite State Machine (FSM)**: a set of states with labelled transitions ("on input `a`, go from state s0 to s1 and output 0"). To test such a system you need to confirm it's really _in_ the state you think it is. The three tools all answer "which state am I in?" by feeding inputs and watching outputs: a **UIO** is a fingerprint for _one_ state, a **DS** is a single fingerprint that identifies _every_ state at once, and a **W-set** is a _collection_ of short inputs that together tell all states apart. UIO and DS don't always exist; a W-set always does (for a well-behaved FSM).

**Key definitions.**

- **Mealy FSM** = ⟨S, I, O, s₀, δ, λ⟩ — states S, inputs I, outputs O, start state s₀, a next-state function δ (state+input→state), an output function λ (state+input→output). "Mealy" means the output is produced **on the transition** (it depends on both the current state and the input), not just on the state.
- **Four assumed properties:** **completely specified** (every state has a defined transition & output for every input — δ,λ are "total"), **deterministic** (one input → exactly one next state), **reduced** (no two states behave identically — otherwise you couldn't tell them apart), **strongly connected** (you can get from any state to any other). The UIO/DS/W theory assumes _reduced_.
- **UIO (Unique Input-Output) for state sᵢ** — an input sequence whose _output_ is **different from what every other state would produce** on that same sequence. So observing that output proves "I was in sᵢ" — a fingerprint for one state. An FSM "has a UIO" only if **every** state has one.
- **Distinguishing Sequence (DS)** — one _single_ input sequence that yields a **different output for every state** — one fingerprint that identifies all states at once. A DS ⇒ every state trivially has a UIO. Not every reduced FSM has a DS.
- **Characterizing set W** — a _set_ of sequences {w₁,…,wₖ} that **together** tell all states apart (no single one has to; the combination does). Always exists for a reduced FSM. A DS is just the special case where one sequence suffices (|W|=1).
- Key implication (exam favorite): **if even one state has no UIO ⇒ there is no DS** (because a DS would hand every state a UIO). The reverse isn't true.

**The recipes.**

_(a) Find/refute a UIO for sᵢ:_ build a UIO tree of path vectors; apply each input, split states by output, track next-states. Terminal when sᵢ becomes a **singleton** (success — path = UIO), or sᵢ shares (output, next-state) with another state (**dead**), or path **repeats** (loop). No branch yields a singleton ⇒ **sᵢ has no UIO**. Rigorous refutation: for each input, show sᵢ shares the same output AND next-state with another state ⇒ inseparable forever.

_(b) DS tree:_ node = **partition of S into blocks**. Develop on input x: within each block group states by output on x; child blocks = each group's next-states. Prune:

| Rule               | Condition                             | Meaning                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **D1 homogeneous** | a block has a **repeated state**      | inseparable → prune (dead)           |
| **D2 singleton**   | **every** block is a singleton        | root→node path **is a DS** (success) |
| **D3 loop**        | child block already on root→node path | prune                                |

First D2 ⇒ DS = that input path. All branches die D1/D3 ⇒ **no DS**.

_(c) Characterizing set W:_ build the output table for short words (length 1, then 2, …); greedily pick words so **every pair of states differs on ≥1 word**; present W + per-state output table; the per-state output **column-vectors must all be distinct**.

_(d) Conformance tests:_ "conformance testing" = checking a real implementation matches the FSM spec. A **transfer sequence** `transfer(sᵢ)` is just a shortest input sequence that drives the machine from the start state s₀ to state sᵢ (so you can reach the state you want to test). Build them with a BFS **spanning tree** from s₀; the collection is the **state cover**. Then `V` is your chosen state-identifier (UIO, DS, or W).

- **State coverage** (verify every state exists): for each sᵢ, run `transfer(sᵢ)·V(sᵢ)` — go to sᵢ, then apply its fingerprint to confirm you're really there.
- **Transition coverage** (verify every transition, stronger): for each edge sᵢ—x→sⱼ, run `transfer(sᵢ)·x·V(sⱼ)` — go to sᵢ, take input `x`, then fingerprint to confirm you landed in the expected sⱼ. Transition coverage ⊋ state coverage (⊋ = strictly stronger). (Weaker alternative: a **transition tour** from s₀ that just walks every edge and checks outputs, without confirming the target state.)

**Worked example 1 — prove no UIO ⇒ no DS.** 3 states, I={a,b}, O={0,1}:

| state | a      | b      |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| s0    | s1 / 0 | s2 / 0 |
| s1    | s0 / 1 | s2 / 0 |
| s2    | s1 / 0 | s0 / 1 |

s0 on **a**: s0→(0)s1 and s2→(0)s1 — same output AND next-state ⇒ inseparable. s0 on **b**: s0→(0)s2 and s1→(0)s2 — same. Every UIO starts with a or b; both fail ⇒ **s0 has no UIO ⇒ no UIO ⇒ no DS.** DS tree confirms: both root children homogeneous (D1).
_Change (s2→s0) to b/0:_ the blocking collisions (a: s0,s2→s1/0; b: s0,s1→s2/0) don't involve that edge ⇒ **still no UIO, no DS.** (Always re-check the changed edge first.)

**Worked example 2 — DS exists; show the tree.** 5 states; following branch **aba**:

```
root      [ {0,1,2,3,4} ]
  └─a→    [ {0,2,3}, {1,2} ]
       └─b→ [ {0},{0},{3,4},{3} ]
            └─a→ [ {1},{2},{2},{3},{3} ]   ★ D2 all singletons ⇒ DS = a·b·a
```

Verification (all 5 outputs of `aba` distinct): s0=001, s1=100, s2=101, s3=110, s4=010.

**(b) Minimum DS size for n states.** A DS must give a distinct output string to each of n states; with |O|=m, length L gives ≤ mᴸ strings ⇒ `L ≥ ⌈log_m n⌉`. A safe bound (binary, m=2): **min DS length = ⌈log₂ n⌉ + 1**. → n=5 ⇒ **3**; n=23 ⇒ **5**.

**Worked example 3 — no DS, give W.** FSM: s0 a/0→s1, b/0→s2; s1 a/0→s1, b/1→s1; s2 a/1→s2, b/0→s2.
Root: on **a**, s0,s1 both →s1/0 (D1); on **b**, s0,s2 both →s2/0 (D1) ⇒ **no DS.**
**W = {a, b}** (minimal): _a_ separates {s0,s1} from s2; _b_ separates {s0,s2} from s1. Output vectors s0=(0,0), s1=(0,1), s2=(1,0) — distinct ✓. Dropping either word merges a pair.

**Exam patterns & gotchas.**

- **Prove non-existence rigorously:** give the structural reason — the (output, next-state) **collision** between two states means no input ever separates them; back it with the pruned tree (all branches D1/D3).
- **No UIO ⇒ no DS** (use freely); reverse is false.
- **"Change one label":** re-check whether the changed edge is one of the colliding ones; one label change can create or destroy a DS.
- **Min DS size:** ⌈log_m n⌉ (+1 binary). Memorize n=5→3, n=23→5.
- **No DS ⇒ use W** (always works for reduced FSM); substitute W wherever you'd use the DS in conformance tests.

**Cheat sheet — UIO vs DS vs W:**

|                | UIO                     | DS                     | W                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | --- | ---------------------- |
| What           | one seq per state       | one seq for all states | a _set_ of seqs          |
| Count          | n seqs (varied lengths) | 1                      | k≥1                      |
| Always exists? | No                      | No                     | **Yes** (reduced FSM)    |
| Built via      | UIO tree                | DS tree                | output table, pair-cover |
| Relation       | DS ⇒ all UIOs           | DS ⇒ each UIO          |                          | W   | =1 ⇒ that word is a DS |

DS-tree pruning: **D1** repeated state in a block = dead; **D2** all singletons = DS found; **D3** repeated block = loop. Conformance: spanning tree → state cover → `transfer·V` per state; transition cover = `transfer(sᵢ)·x·V(sⱼ)` per edge.

## 9. Black-box Techniques (ECP, BVA, Decision Tables, Domain)

> **Plain words:** "Black-box" means you pick test inputs from the _specification_ alone, without looking at the code inside. The problem is still "too many inputs" — so these techniques are smart ways to choose a few representatives. **ECP:** group inputs that _should be treated the same_ and test one from each group. **BVA:** bugs love edges, so test right at and just past the boundaries between groups. **Decision tables:** when the output depends on several yes/no conditions, tabulate the combinations. **Domain testing:** picture the input space as regions separated by boundary lines, and test points _on and just off_ each boundary to catch a mis-drawn boundary.

**Key definitions.**

- **Equivalence class / partition (EC):** a group of inputs the program _should_ handle identically (e.g. "all ages 18–65"). Split into **valid** and **invalid** groups. Testing one representative per group stands in for the whole group — that's the saving.
- **Boundary value:** a value right at, or just next to, the edge of an equivalence class. Off-by-one and `<` vs `≤` bugs cluster exactly here, so these are high-value tests.
- **Decision table:** a table of conditions (each Y / N / `–` where `–` = "doesn't matter") across the top × **rules** (columns) → resulting actions. `n` conditions give up to `2ⁿ` combinations; combine columns that share the same action using don't-cares (`–`); each surviving column becomes one test case.
- **Category-partition:** a systematic method — break the spec into **categories** (input characteristics) → each into **choices** (the partitions) → add **constraints** to prune nonsense combinations (`[property]`, `[if…]`, `[error]`, `[single]`) → generate **test frames** (concrete combinations).
- **Domain vs computation error:** think of the program as sorting each input into a region ("subdomain") and computing a result for it. A **domain error** = the input took the _wrong region/path_ because a **condition** (`if`) is wrong. A **computation error** = right region/path but the _value_ computed is wrong because an **assignment** is wrong. A program is thus a **classifier** that partitions the input space into subdomains.
- **Boundary geometry:** a **closed** boundary _includes_ its edge points (`≤` / `≥`); an **open** boundary _excludes_ them (`<` / `>`). **Adjacent domains** share a boundary; an **extreme point** is where two boundaries cross.
- **Three boundary errors** (ways a boundary line can be coded wrong): **closure** (`≤` written as `<` — right line, wrong include/exclude), **shifted** (right slope, wrong position — wrong constant, e.g. `x+y>5` coded `x+y>4`), **tilted** (wrong slope — wrong coefficient, e.g. `x+y>5` coded `x+0.5y>5`).
- **ON point:** a point lying _exactly on_ the boundary (the equality holds). **OFF point:** a point _just off_ the boundary — for a **closed** boundary it sits just _outside_ (in the adjacent domain); for an **open** boundary it sits just _inside_ the domain. (This flip is the #1 thing to get right — see gotchas.)

**The recipe.**

- _ECP:_ range → 1 valid + 2 invalid; set → 1 valid per member + 1 invalid; "must be" → 1 valid + 1 invalid. One test per valid class (combine valids); **one separate test per invalid class** (never combine invalids).
- _BVA:_ for `[a,b]` test `a−ε, a, a+ε, b−ε, b, b+ε` + nominal. Classic `[−10,10]` → `−10.1, −10, 9.9, 10, 10.1`.
- _Decision table:_ `2ⁿ` rules → fill effects → merge don't-care columns → each column = test.
- _Domain (ON–OFF–ON):_ per boundary, two **ON** points (A,B) spread along it + one **OFF** point (C) → sequence A,C,B. Two ONs catch tilt; ON/OFF pair catches shift + closure.

**Worked example.** `discount(qty)`: 0% if `qty<10`, 10% if `10≤qty≤99`, 20% if `qty≥100`; positive int.

- ECP: invalid `qty≤0`; valid `[1,9]`,`[10,99]`,`[100,∞)`.
- BVA: `0,1,9,10,99,100,large`. Boundaries `9|10`, `99|100` hide closure/shift faults.
- Domain: boundary `qty=10` closed on 10%-side; ON=`10` (10%), OFF=`9` (0%). If code wrote `qty>10` (closure error), ON point `10` wrongly gets 0% → caught.

**Exam patterns & gotchas.**

- _Never merge two invalid ECs_ — can't tell which triggered the failure.
- Domain error = conditional fault; computation error = assignment fault. Boundary-interior / ON-OFF target **domain (boundary) errors**.
- **Closed boundary → OFF outside; open boundary → OFF inside** (#1 deduction).
- BVA _extends_ ECP, doesn't replace it.

## 10. JUnit & Tooling Reference (Pitest, JaCoCo)

> **Plain words:** This section is the _practical_ toolkit — the actual Java tools that implement the ideas above. **JUnit** = the framework you write tests in (an `assert…` that throws if the program misbehaves). **Pitest** = the tool that automates mutation testing from §1 (it plants the mutants and runs your tests against each). **JaCoCo** = the tool that measures coverage from §2 (which lines/branches your tests actually ran). Exam questions here are usually "given this code and these tests, what does the tool report?" — so know how each tool _counts_.

**Key definitions.**

- **JUnit:** the Java unit-test framework. A test does: create the object → set up inputs → state the expected result → run the code → **assert** the result matches. A failed assertion throws `AssertionFailedError`; related tests group into _suites_.
- **Mutant / killed / survived / equivalent** and the **score `100·D/(N−E)`** — all defined in §1.
- **Pitest (PIT):** a JVM mutation-testing tool. It applies its default **mutators** (the tiny changes) to your compiled bytecode and re-runs your test suite once per mutant, reporting which survived.
- **JaCoCo:** a coverage tool. It has several counters (instruction / line / branch / complexity / method / class); the exam cares about **statement (line)** and **branch** coverage. Run with `mvn test jacoco:report`.

**JUnit assertions (write precisely).**

| Assertion                                | Use                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `assertEquals(expected, actual)`         | object/primitive equality (`.equals`)                      |
| `assertEquals(expected, actual, delta)`  | **doubles/floats — MUST give a tolerance** (e.g. `1e-9`)   |
| `assertTrue(cond)` / `assertFalse(cond)` | booleans                                                   |
| `assertNull` / `assertNotNull`           | null checks                                                |
| `assertSame` / `assertNotSame`           | **reference identity (`==`)**, not value                   |
| `assertArrayEquals(exp, act)`            | array contents                                             |
| `assertThrows(Ex.class, exec)`           | code throws the expected exception (returns it to inspect) |
| `fail(msg)`                              | force failure (unreached-branch guards)                    |

**Full JUnit example (class under test + a test class).** This is the shape an exam wants when it says "write a JUnit test class." Note the anatomy: `@BeforeEach` for shared setup, one `@Test` per behaviour, a **delta** on the double assertion, boundary inputs, and an `assertThrows` for the error path.

    }

    public double getBalance() { return balance; }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("amount must be > 0");
        balance += amount;
    }

    /** @return true iff the withdrawal succeeded (enough funds). */
    public boolean withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("amount must be > 0");
        if (amount > balance) return false;   // insufficient funds

    }

    @Test
    void deposit_nonPositive_throws() {                 // error path
        assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> acct.deposit(0.0));
    }

    @Test
    void constructor_negativeOpening_throws() {
        assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> new BankAccount(-1.0));
    }
}
```

Why these tests: `withdraw` has the comparison `amount > balance`, so the two boundary tests (`amount == balance` and `amount` just above it) are what kill the `>` → `>=` **CONDITIONALS_BOUNDARY** mutant (§1); testing only far-from-boundary amounts would let it survive. `@BeforeEach` guarantees each test starts from a clean `BankAccount`, so an order-dependent bug can't hide.

**JaCoCo counters (denominators).**

- **Statement/line:** denominator = executable lines/instructions; a line covered if any instruction ran.
- **Branch:** denominator = branch outcomes = **2 per decision**. JaCoCo counts at **bytecode** → each atomic boolean in `&&`/`||` contributes its own pair. `if(A)` → 2; `if(A && B)` → 4.

**Worked example.** `f(y){ if(y>0) return 2*y; if(y<0) return -3*y; return 0; }` with tests `f(5)=10, f(-2)=6, f(0)=0`:

- `y>0→y>=0`: at `y=0` both return 0 ⇒ **equivalent**. `y<0→y<=0`: at `y=0` both return 0 ⇒ **equivalent**.
- `2*y→2/y`: `f(5)` → `2/5=0≠10` ⇒ **killed**. `-3*y→-3/y`: `f(-2)` → `-3/-2=1≠6` ⇒ **killed**.
- N=4, E=2, D=2 → **score 100×2/(4−2) = 100%**. State the survivors are equivalent; don't "fix" them.

**Exam patterns & gotchas.**

- **CONDITIONALS_BOUNDARY at an untested boundary value → often equivalent.** Always test the equality case to decide.
- `a*b→b*a`, `x+0→x`, mutating unreachable code ⇒ equivalent.
- **100% branch coverage ⇏ all mutants killed.** The _oracle_ is the assertion that decides pass/fail; a **weak oracle** runs the mutated line and the mutant even computes a _different_ value, but the assertion is too loose to notice — so the mutant survives despite full coverage. Typical sub-question: _"write a test that covers the mutated statement yet still passes on the mutant."_ Example — `int f(int x){ return x*2; }` with mutant `*→+` (so `f(3)` is 6 in the original, 5 in the mutant). The test `assertTrue(f(3) > 0)` executes the line but only checks the sign — `6>0` and `5>0` both hold ⇒ mutant survives. Fix: assert the exact value, `assertEquals(6, f(3))`, which sees `5 ≠ 6` ⇒ killed.
- Always put the **delta on double `assertEquals`**. Score denominator is **N − E**, never N.

## 11. Exam Playbook & Master Cheat Sheets

> **Plain words:** This is the exam-day section — no new theory, just _how to attack a question_. The first table maps a question's shape ("archetype") to the section that answers it, so you can jump straight there. The second table is the single most important thing to get right under pressure: **denominators** — when a question asks for "coverage %" you must state _exactly what is being counted_ (lines? edges? conditions?). The last list is the recurring reasons students lose marks.

### Question archetype → topic

| Archetype                                   | What it asks                                                                                                                       | §       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **A Mutation / score**                      | survive vs kill, flag equivalents, `D/(N−E)`, add tests for 100%; or write a weak-assertion test where a mutant survives, then fix | §1, §10 |
| **B AETG pair-count**                       | first param fixed; for each candidate order count new pairs; which wins; resulting π                                               | §5      |
| **C IPO/OA growth**                         | horizontal growth for new param, then which tuples vertical growth adds & why                                                      | §5      |
| **D CFG + boundary-interior**               | draw CFG (number nodes), minimal boundary-interior path set, subsumption vs branch                                                 | §2      |
| **E Dataflow / subsumption counterexample** | "show X does NOT subsume Y — program + suite"                                                                                      | §3, §4  |
| **F Symbolic → ERROR**                      | PC reaching ERROR, feasibility + sample input, false-branch-first, branch denominator                                              | §6      |
| **G Concolic table**                        | concrete+symbolic+PC table over a struct, start int at 0, until ERROR                                                              | §7      |
| **H FSM UIO/DS/W**                          | prove no UIO; DS tree; characterizing set W; min DS size                                                                           | §8      |
| **(I) MC/DC** (sub-part)                    | minimal MC/DC suite (~N+1 tests); pseudocode                                                                                       | §2, §6  |

### Denominators cheat sheet (state EXACTLY what is counted)

| Metric                       | Denominator = number of …                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Statement (line)**         | executable statements/lines (JaCoCo: instructions)                                  |
| **Branch (decision)**        | **2 per decision** (true & false); JaCoCo bytecode → 2 per atomic boolean in `&&`/` |
| **Basic (atomic) condition** | **2 × #atomic conditions**                                                          |
| **Branch-and-condition**     | branch + basic-condition obligations                                                |
| **Compound condition**       | **2ᴺ** combinations of the N atoms in a decision                                    |
| **MC/DC**                    | one independence obligation per atom → suite ≈ **N+1**                              |

Sanity: `if (A && B)` → branch **4**, basic-condition **4**, compound **2²=4**, MC/DC **3** tests.

### Things examiners always deduct for

- **No justification**
- **Counting equivalent mutants in the denominator** / not arguing why a mutant is equivalent / trying to "kill" an equivalent mutant.
- **Including infeasible paths**, or claiming a symbolic path reachable without a satisfying input (or unreachable without proving UNSAT).
- **Wrong branch order in symbolic execution** — convention is **false branch first**.
- **Miscounting pairs in AETG/IPO** (not listing each pair, double-counting covered pairs, wrong candidate).
- **CFG mistakes:** unnumbered nodes, ignoring `&&`/`||` short-circuit as separate branches, non-minimal/loop-not-exercised boundary-interior set.
- **Double `assertEquals` with no delta.** **OFF-point on the wrong side** of an open/closed boundary.
